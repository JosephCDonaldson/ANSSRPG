#Help I have a problem!

First thing you should ways do is run your configs through http://jsonlint.com/ to see if they are valid Json

If that doesn't resolve your issue pastebin your logs (even if you don't think they will help) as well as your config files and create an [issue](https://github.com/disconsented/ANSSRPG/issues)
